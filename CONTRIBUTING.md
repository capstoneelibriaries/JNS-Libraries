### Ids

The id's need to follow a consistent format that makes using jQuery simple
and predictable. The following format for naming items is advized:

#### On Forms

> id="'file name'-'form name'-'form item'"

#### Buttons

All buttons should be prefaced with "btn", indicating the element is displayed
as a button.

> id="btn-'file name'-'item'"
